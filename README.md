<strong>And select premedium folder</strong>

## How To Use
    I strongly recommend use this extension with any reader mode extension. This extension is not for visual purposes it's only for paywall.

    I'm using Clearly Reader and it's great even on free tier.

If you encounter an article for premium users only just click extension icon from extensions bar. After that you can use your reader extension as same as it before. Just use premedium extension first.
